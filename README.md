# golang chess engine
now this is a chess engine i have been working on for roughly 2 months. I've just come to the end of move generation, fully completing it all with checks, en passant, loading from fen, ray pieces, blocking, pinning, everything. All that is left is to do an evalution function and then do alpha beta pruning and I will have a complete chess engine.

This is one of my more favourited projects (by me)
